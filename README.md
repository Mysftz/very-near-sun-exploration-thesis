<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Introduction

The Solar Orbiter probe is currently the only probe designed to observe the Sun at 0.28AU from its surface, the closest man-made probe ever to orbit the Sun. In this project we discuss the possibility of a mission that travels within 0.2AU of the Sun's surface. To do so, a future probe must be protected by a heat shield manufactured from titanium alloys and thermoresistant materials to withstand the temperature of the Sun and be powered by an on-board electrical power unit that assists the solar panels. The probe can send data via radio or a laser that incorporates PPM (pulse position modulation) to combat the interference from the Sun and Earth's atmosphere, such data can include: the ionization of the Sun’s atmosphere, the effect and shape of the Sun's magnetosphere and data on the Sun’s coronal activity. Faraday cups, magnetometers, thermal gauges, X-ray/UV sensors and other instruments must be installed alongside the power units, data transmitters and other on-board systems, and sensors that are encased in the probes hull. These must be able to withstand  hazards of space travel such as the Sun's temperature and solar flares, and space debris. The probe is fitted with redundancy systems as the probe must be largely independent as it travels through space and orbits the Sun. 

This project has explored and discussed many aspects of a potential near sun exploration mission, including mission purpose, instrumentation, and communications. The proposed mission's purpose would be primarily to gather data on solar weather, such as CMEs (coronal mass ejections), solar maxima and minima, and the Sun's changing magnetic field. Whilst this investigation would be of great scientific value, particularly in the study of energetic solar particles, the mission could justify itself economically with the greater understanding of solar weather it could bring. Understanding what drives solar weather events might allow us to build models with predictive power, allowing us to mitigate the risk of damage to our Earth and space based equipment from power surges. In this way, answering questions about the dynamics of the near sun environment will simultaneously provide scientific and financial benefits. 

Furthermore, understanding the Sun as a power source may provide insights into Earth based nuclear fusion technology. In order to collect this data the proposed probe would be equipped with a magnetometer (for measuring the magnetic fields around the Sun), a Faraday cup (for counting particles) a mass spectrometer (to identify isotopes) and a thermal gauge (to measure the temperature of the probe and its surroundings). The logistics of communication between the Earth and Sun has also been discussed - the possibility of using Deep Space Optical Communications as an alternative to traditional radio frequencies has been evaluated, and it was found that this could be a cost effective option but its efficacy will be dependent on mission specifics such as orbital eccentricity. Additionally, the technology is in the early stages of its development, so whether or not this could be used may depend on future test mission results.

The spacecraft is advised to utilise a honeycomb structure as part of its heat shield to keep the overall mass down, while the use of aluminium, steel and titanium can offer protection against impacts and thermal damage. Steel and lead or copper may provide protection against the radiation that it will encounter. The spacecraft design would operate such that certain materials will reflect the heat and allow the interior of the spacecraft to remain cooler and as the interior must be protected from the radiation. Thermal resistant properties are not required for these materials. Nanotubes offer a lightweight, high strength and thermoresistant properties and can be used to line the external side of the main hull to offer an increase in heat resistant properties where needed. 

This project was exclusively literature based as we can only base our research on data from previous missions. However, in the future, it would be useful to devise a simulation to test some simple features of the proposed probe in the near-Sun environment. For example, modelling the effect of extreme temperatures on the materials suggested for use, or simulating the regions in the probe's orbit where communications would or would not be possible. It was felt during this project that not enough specifics of the mission design were known to construct such a simulation, but with more time and information this would be an opportunity for further research. Due to the vast amount of relevant information to this project, further literature review would also be valuable.  

Future research should investigate more specifically the logistics of the proposed mission. It should look at the orbit the solar probe should attain, as this affects the possibilities for communications and will determine what temperatures, and for how long, the probe would be exposed to. At this stage it was not known precisely to within what distance of the Sun the proposed probe would be able to travel safely. It should also provide a costing for the probe described in this report, by determining the approximate cost and mass of materials and instruments. It should also resolve some unanswered questions, such as whether optical communications would be a viable alternative to radio. This could be achieved with the help of simulations, and by comparing to the costs of previous similar missions such as the Solar Orbiter or the Parker Solar probe. Overall, this project has explored the topics it set out to and investigated the value of a very near-Sun mission and some of the ways in which this can be accomplished.
